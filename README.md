# YouTube Ad Muter Extension ðŸ”‡

A lightweight Chrome extension that automatically mutes YouTube ads and skips them when possible. Because nobody has time for loud, obnoxious ads when you're just trying to vibe to music.

## What This Does

- **Auto-mutes** YouTube ads instantly
- **Auto-clicks** skip buttons when they appear
- **Runs silently** in the background
- **Zero configuration** needed

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. That's it. Go watch YouTube ad-free.

## How It Works

The extension uses content scripts to detect YouTube ads and automatically:
- Mute the video player when ads are detected
- Click skip buttons as soon as they become available
- Restore normal volume when ads end
